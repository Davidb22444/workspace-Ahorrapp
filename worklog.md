- Created `/home/z/my-project/src/components/ahorrapp/TransactionCenter.tsx` (329 lines):
  - Unified timeline merging income + expenses + unexpected into single sorted list
  - Each transaction shows: date, type icon (green ArrowUpRight for income, red ArrowDownRight for expense/unexpected), description, category badge with color dot, amount (colored green/red/amber), and type-specific meta (source/frequency for income, recurring badge for expenses, resolved status for unexpected)

- Ran `bun run lint` — zero errors

Stage Summary:
- Two new modules fully integrated: Transaction Center (advanced search & filters) and Monthly Report (comprehensive financial overview)

Task ID: 7
Agent: Main Orchestrator
Task: Bug fixes, QA testing, new features, styling polish (Round 3)

Work Log:
- **QA via agent-browser**: Tested all modules end-to-end, discovered 3 critical runtime bugs
- **Bug Fix 1 - ExpenseModule crash**: `unexpected.filter is not a function` — API returns `{unexpecteds:[], total}` but code read `data.expenses`. Fixed by checking `data.unexpecteds` first with `Array.isArray()` guards
- **Bug Fix 2 - Data mapping**: API returns nested `category: {name, color}` objects but components expected flat `category: string`. Added `mapApiExpense()` and `mapApiUnexpected()` mapper functions to properly transform API responses
- **Bug Fix 3 - BudgetModule crash**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'planned')` — API returns `{budgets: [...]}` with Prisma schema fields but component expected transformed `BudgetData`. Added `mapApiBudget()` mapper
- **Bug Fix 4 - UnexpectedModule**: Same API response format issue. Fixed with `mapApiUnexpected()` mapper
- **Bug Fix 5 - CSS parsing error**: `@media print` block used escaped Tailwind class selector. Replaced with `[class*="..."]` attribute selectors
- **New Feature - Spending Heatmap Calendar**: Daily spending visualization on Dashboard with 5-tier color coding, tooltip, today indicator
- **New Feature - Net Worth Trend Chart**: Gradient area chart showing cumulative net position over 6 months
- **New Feature - Monthly Comparison Cards**: 3 cards comparing this month vs last month for Income, Expenses, Net Savings
- **New Feature - Transaction Center**: Unified timeline with advanced filters (date/amount range, type, category, search), summary bar, pagination
- **New Feature - Monthly Report**: Comprehensive financial report with month navigation, key metrics, breakdowns, print support
- **Styling Polish**: 7 new CSS utilities, 7 keyframes, sidebar active pulse dot + hover scale, auth floating blobs + glassmorphism, income table alternating rows, savings progress shimmer
- **API**: Created `/api/dashboard/daily-spending/route.ts`
- All 13 modules verified with zero JS errors via agent-browser

Stage Summary:
- 5 critical bugs fixed (3 runtime crashes, 1 data mapping, 1 CSS parsing)
- 5 new features added (heatmap, net worth, comparison cards, transaction center, monthly report)
- 15 component files, ~8400 lines total, zero lint errors
- All modules pass QA

## Current Project Status (as of Round 3)
- **Phase**: Post-MVP feature expansion complete, all bugs fixed
- **Architecture**: Next.js 16 SPA with Prisma/SQLite, 15 component files (~8400 lines)

- Created `/api/achievements/route.ts` — GET endpoint that computes 12 financial achievements on-the-fly from existing data (no new Prisma model). Uses parallel queries for performance. Achievements: First Income, First Expense, Saver Starter ($1k), Big Saver ($10k), Debt Free, Budget Master, Tracker Pro (100 transactions), Safety Net (emergency fund), Goal Setter, Recurring Planner, Income Diversifier, Prepared Planner.
- Created `/api/annual-summary/route.ts` — GET endpoint returning comprehensive annual financial summary: monthly breakdown (12 months), top expense categories with percentages, income source breakdown, savings goals progress, month-over-month changes, best/worst month. Accepts `?accountId=xxx&year=2025`.
- Created `/api/import/route.ts` — POST endpoint for CSV import via multipart form data. Supports income, expense, and auto-detect modes. Custom CSV parser handles quoted fields and escaped quotes. Auto-detects import type from column headers. Matches expense categories by name (case-insensitive). Returns `{ imported, errors }` response.
- All routes follow existing patterns: `db` from `@/lib/db`, `NextRequest`/`NextResponse`, `accountId` param, try/catch error handling.
- Zero lint errors.

Stage Summary:
- 3 new API routes created: achievements (computed), annual-summary (aggregated), import (CSV)
- All use existing Prisma models with no schema changes
- Zero lint errors
